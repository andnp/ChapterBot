hey guys, i have to go fly out to colorado this weekend to visit their grad program. is there any way someone could be a super bro and drive me to/from the airport on thursday and saturday? i promise i'll pay for gas. and maybe throw in a few other...favors ;)
gotcha. nice vocab word though.
anyhoo my flight on thursday leaves at 6:35pm and i return saturday at 1:23pm
so i'd probably need to leave town around 4:00pm on thursday
bahaha
i'm not sure i could get those through airport security
will are you going to be busy then?
well shit.
i mean poop
dotw
you would be my hero
gimme a little bit to ask around but if you're free at those times i would be super appreciative
sorry to hear it bro. welcome to the club. solidarity.
heh. "internet penetration"
only to become zombie jesus
oh yeah zombie jesus is the line
lol you guys should make more holocaust jokes because apparently those aren't as offensive
well obviously i attend chapter regularly so i would know
gotcha
lol jacob, you are the one who brought this shit up what are you talking about?

#christmastree2015
do you kids know the legend of the christmas tree? it was a thing back when i was a freshman/sophomore
every year an embarrassing photo of a brother was chosen to grace the walls of the house. blown up to life size proportions. things like jemily snuggling the cracken, and a photo-shopped picture of wei fucking a panda
it was glorious
yup.
well the picture was on wei wearing a panda suit, so naturally he had to be having sex with another panda
no idea. they usually printed them off on like dozens of regular pages and taped them together in order.
i think the idea at the beginning of the year was to use lucas' picture of kdr guys photo shopped into an old painting of napoleon

i'm pretty sure that picture of me was taken when the dude got his dick ripped off in vhs
entertain me, swine!
lol. im sure he'll have a short list
something along the lines of, "we hate fun."
I see Andy posted a neat graphic with fun information on it. I shall give him praise in this group instead if the official KDR groupme.
I see Jacob posted in the KDR announcements incorrectly, i shall post my comment here.
We almost lasted. A day...
Lol you good
....... Now we can't go an hour without posting in the wrong groupme...
I'd much prefer that committee over my current one
I will take the presidential role, and boss around the co chairs
Yeah, I'm not fully on board, i would like to see how it could be used and how it could be given authority and legitimacy.
Hey make sure you keep in mind that a lot of those points aren't mutually exclusive. I've been saying for years that one of the biggest benefits of little 500 was that it increases people's awareness of KDR and builds alumni relations. It's also huge for our philanthropic efforts. We raised more money for working student scholarships than any other Greek organization (yes, we beat the big guys like beta, DTD, etc.) over the course of two years.
I know I'm beating a dead horse here but even if it's not little 500 you guys should think about ways to address multiple points with single activities
That's not how you spell that word
Also how did you come up with the cost/benefit amounts? Little 500 costs the chapter $500 (more if you want to be competitive, but we never really spent more than that). That's A LOT less than it costs to get a house on campus.
Gotcha
I guess a big thing I would say too then is that a lot of those costs and benefits have to do with our perceptions. Like growing the chapter can be very expensive. And if it's not done correctly, it isn't even that beneficial. Like when we were at 612 we had a large spring pledge class but it didn't go much of anywhere, unfortunately.
I agree with a lot of that tbh, I just want to make it very clear that how we pursue those goals is more important than the actual ratings
Like how do we want to increase awareness of KDR?
How do we want to increase philanthropic involvement?
How do we want to increase recruitment?
The biggest hurdle to little 500 isn't training, it's organization. Having a set schedule and making b sure the team is all on the same page (that means acting like a team and hanging out/working together) is much more time consuming than anything else.
But really the thing to keep in mind is to have an "if you build it they will come" mentality. It only really takes one or two people to commit to little 500, and then others will be drawn to their example.
So I would say don't be worried about whether people will train right now, be worried about making sure you have the structure in place to enable a team.
Agreed. Let's finish this via text.
Honestly little 500 and IUDM are your best options
We need to be doing IUDM
I had lots of conversations with Ryan about this... KDR will not be legitimate in the eyes of the Greek community until we do both those events
They are "necessary but not sufficient"
Brothers should join clubs in groups of 2 or 3
Here's the thing: the club idea has been around for a looong time. But there are two big problems: 1) you'll never get people to join random clubs if they don't want to. 2) it steals a lot of time and commitment that would normally go directly to KDR functions.
Absolutely. We've had trouble with brother retention because of club involvement before.
It doesn't have to be that way, but it's another reason I say bros should join in groups
Alright guys this is good but think about how it fits KDR. My sense is that if you ask the chapter as a whole there will be a lot of foot dragging
I mean that if you suggest hosting a resume workshop in chapter on Sunday a lot of people just won't be that interested. I could be wrong. But the point is you guys need to think about KDR's "brand" and cater ideas to that.
Well sure. But what's the group identify? Everyone should branch out, but any big event should play on your strengths.
I think it might be much more worthwhile for you guys to attend a resume workshop as a group rather than host one.
Alright, just make the decision as a group.
Like call a chapter vote, don't just dictate through a committee decision
Yo, so can someone bring the flightwheel with them to sportsball tonight?
Hey Pat are you still down to drive me to the airport on Thursday?? :D
Also who is coming to wright? We're meeting at 6:30 still right?
You guys should go! I thought it was kickball though... At least that's what the event was in the past
so i'll be free around 7:00... anyone wanna play frisbee?
i mean flightwheel?
goooood. anyone else?
so jelly ï¿½
i'll play, but i'll be late
fuck guys i just got an email from osu i need to respond to immediately. i can't make it to frisbee right now, sorry
letters are good but not 100% necessary. athletic shorts maybe moreso
yeah man house guests have the responsibility to make their own beds
and don't you forget it

wait what??
sean you're leaving in a month?!
in the fall... i want to say october some time?
maybe november?
yeah, so this ties into what i was saying. how are you going to recruit more? and how are you going to host more open events? the last one especially is very expensive
yeah... you'll be dead.
awww shit yeah
hornung you beautiful man you
cog psy!
represent
uhhh... it's you're*** omg willy j i'm so disappointed
did he say it or type it?
suck it jordan!
i still love you, i just like being an asshole
lol someone actually did that?
these kids want attention so bad
ps did it get taken down?
i also like to blame my problems on rich white men
ugh
oh boy

... and muted.
hey so fun sorry. the universe is 13.7 billion years old and every atom in your body exists because nuclear fusion within ancient stars forced hydrogen atoms to combine into heavier elements. then they went super nova, formed nebulae, which formed new stars and solar systems over billions of years.
my comment?
yeah man. the bible is the only truth i need.
yeah but what proved that the world wasn't flat? science.
well, jordan it took billions and billions of years
it wasn't just like someone shook up the universe to see what came out
its completely plausible that life is a symptom of universal coincidence; our solar system at this time just happens to satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for life.
life probably exists elsewhere too -- just look up the drake equation
well actually earth doesn't perfectly support life. for that matter, for the vast majority of its existence earth didn't support life at all. and in a couple billion years it won't support life at all.
 sean: absolutely. but we were talking about life, not intelligent life
for that matter, it's likely that any extra terrestrial life will be extinct by the time we find it, or that humanity will be by the time it finds us
fun fact: gravity acts at the same universal constant as light
so if the sun were to disappear not only would we not know for 8 minutes, but we'd keep rotating  around nothing during that time as well
well there are more atoms in your body than there are stars in the universe
and there are more stars than there are grains of sand in all earth's beaches combines
combined*
so... recreating the same combination due to random chance is highly unlikely
in conclusion: yolo
http://geneticsawareness.org/learn-about-genetics/have-questions-about-genetics/are-identical-twins-100-genetically-identical
identical by nature, different by nurture.
yeah but excluding the example of identical twins you're probably right sean
two children from two different eggs/sperm (with the same parents) are almost guaranteed to have different dna make ups
did you guys know that the average world iq is dropping?
because the characteristics that make people successful deter them from having lots of kids, but the opposite is true for fuck ups
well on average we are getting more stupid
though the smartest people are just as smart as ever
eh. maybe in the sense that we've kinda destroyed evolutionary mechanisms
like survival of the fittest doesn't exist any more, so dumb people that would never have found a mate before can
nah
economics bro
human capital in industrialized nations is higher than it ever has been
technological advancement, improved efficiency of resource allocation, etcm
^yup.
you know what's cool? the fact that there are a ton of dimensions we can neither experience nor conceptualize
like mathematicians can spend their entire lives just trying to imagine 4d objects
that shit is crazy
but they exist!
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2730791/are-stupid-britons-people-iq-decline.html
just read that
it does a good job taking about both sides of the issue
yeah so those dumb people are probably the same ones that had sex and put it on yeti
... and we've come full circle
theoretically, yes
... well there were words underneath the graph addressing the issue
yeah idk if it's embellished or not though
but i think the consensus is that at least within many western, industrialized nations there has been a downward trend over the last generation
so you just don't believe statistics?
yes. that's why you read any them
about *
bayesian statistics bro
it's the future
http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0124058884/ref=mp_s_a_1_4?qid=1427999023&sr=8-4&pi=ac_sx110_sy165_ql70&keywords=bayesian+statistics&dppl=1&dpid=515erfg9y8l&ref=plsrch
lol. well you're never invited to my family gatherings then jordan
(hint: the author of the book i posted is important)
yeah sample sizes can be too big because they make anything statistically significant
jordan beat me =[
y'all motherfuckers need einstein
dat relativity theory doe
welcome week social events*
why was he removed?
gotcha
we can ask andy later
oh my bad
won't do it again
shhh
back to the other group
shhh
hey so you guys wanna know another interesting fact? because of its expansion, no matter where you are in the universe your perspective will always appear to be the center of the universe.
like the inevitable death of everything in the universe due to entropy?
aww yes, the big rip/big crunch theory
you know what's fucking crazy? dark matter/dark energy
wtf is that shit?
nobody knows.
well since time is cyclical an infinite number
it has and will and is
yeah so i'm at b the airport... i was told to get here like 2 hours early and i made out to my gate in 20 minutes
god dammit =[
i'm going to be sitting here waiting for another 2ish hours

the house of schlager is accepting sons
first thing i'm doing when i get home is punching sean straight in the dick
yeah that sounds right
hah!
did some stupid freshman drink too much and puke/pass out?
probably after having a) pregamed a stupid amount before coming over or b) having the tolerance of a 12 year girl on adderall and consuming 2 light beers?
ps i'm a little drunk and i need to be awake in 4 hours for my shuttle
what happened? i must know.
starting my trip home. sean get ready to be punched in the dick
hey what are people doing for the game tonight? and can an officer ask in the discussion groupme for me?

i feel like that would be amazing.
i love your auto correct sean
dude this is his first time, right?
idk man her butthole is pretty loose too
your father may or may not be klein -- works every time.
i may or may not have been your father, but the dog bear me upstairs
beat*
you can always use the legends of old to kickstart your clues
i.e., your father may or may not have fucked the cracken
krcken
kraken... shit, so this is what it feels like to be sean
your father may or may not have gotten a blow job whilst standing on the sidewalk
your father may or may not shit on the chests of his adversaries
your father may or may not be the result of 4 billion years of successful evolution
... but probably not.
sean if you get another son i will actually cut off your balls
lol.
i will fucking end you, taylor
you're all dead to me
no it went downhill as soon as he became my son
hahaha
truth.
robert and dp were chris's sons
 francis belonged to wei
and didn't jemily have someone besides brian?
the house of schlager has been unlucky at every turn
the other, other dan
obviously
but every dan had always been a schlager
justin never makes trouble!
sleepover at loren's?
but there's so much halo to play
i just took the most relieving poo
ï¿½
:o 
it's okay, you're still beautiful
lol. that's got room for a lot of porn
sweet jesus.
well you won't buy it because you're not 21, but maybe you can pay for it?
why would he need to show you where to buy it if youre just paying for it?

son, i am disappoint.
disappoint, dammit. disappoint.
take it from me, quality > quantity.
and honestly, you sad fucks are losing to cookie right now
says the guy who won't go to the bars
oh nooo... sean needs his sleep
and also his vagina is in so much pain
yeah. honestly it's pretty easy to get into phd programs.
99 percentile*
yeah... good luck finding a job communicating shit
ya filthy animal
actually pure o2 will getcha higghghhhhhh
i can't tell if savagery is good or bad
i would... but i'm busy for the next hour or so =[
from personal experience i can tell you that sushi is a terrible idea before a night of heavy drinking
yeah will i think mr hibachi is mostly a buffet
which will though??
it's okay guys, sean just hates fun.
lol @ bloomington tornado warnings
pretty?
ps i'm staying at the hyatt here fo free! be jealous
trying to find our chapter here... and being wildly unsuccessful
but jacob will be happy to know i found sae
eta chapter, aasssseeemmmbbblllleeee
danger zone
are you sure?
got in 4 days! my chub knows no bounds!
look what i found!
ughh. i juuust sat down to eat =[
i wish you well though
... but next week is little 500?
or is that next next week?
next next week is little 500.
so uh.. anyone wanna talk about really crazy science/intellectual stuff again?

false. disproven by science.
well science was used to create guns, which i will in turn use to murder you
is that what god looks like?
or satan?
the super ginger confuses and infuriates me!
can confirm power level is over 9000 though
i am ashamed to admit i already knew that
frieza saga = best saga imo
gt doesn't even exist
eh. but then cell wouldn't never reached his final form either
yeah i'm pretty sure krillin would've destructo-disced all those assholes into an early grave
and don't give me that bs about buu regenerating and shit
the threadslayer approaches!!
cosmic microwave background radiation
cmbr for short. look it up. it's left over from the big bang and very measurable
remember back when we used antennae for cable tv and there'd be static on certain channels? and small percentage of that was cmbr. to quote sagan, "you were watching the birth of the universe."
vegeta was always my favorite
dudes a badass
basically the entire universe is still reverberating from the big bang. it's not nearly as strong as it once was, but still measurable
that's some crazy, 13.7 billion year old shit.
wow. frieza is the shit. thanks for invalidating every opinion you've ever had, lucas.
uh not really?
frieza was toying with everyone, even goku until he went super saiyan
and even then they were basically just a match but goku had more stamina
plus he murdered the shit out of krillin, which is beyond evil
yes! a lovable, pansy of a side kick
why would anyone kill him other than to  be an evil asshole??
and/or send goku into an unstoppable murder frenzy?
only if by stepping on it krillin somehow died
which isn't too far fetched actually. dudes kinda a pansy
does goku actually kill anyone in the whole series?
i don't think so
he holds raditz in place for piccolo's super beam cannon but that's as close as it gets
oh fuck yeah. gohan murders cell
okay, i was talking dbz and who is yakon?
kid buu is legit though
idk, gohan was always supposed to have higher potential than goku
also just looked up yakon, could be argued that he killed himself
imo only character goku kills is kid buu
nonono i'm taking dbz, not dragonball
talking*
goku murders a fuckton of people in dragonball
it's all based on a chinese fairytale anyway
not quite. after people returned to abandoned areas and began agricultural activities it sucked all the carbon out of the air
so it wasn't that dear natives couldn't farm, it's that once they came back they farmed a shit ton
co2 you right aaron
but global heating/cooling patterns have anyways been a mystery
like the faint young sun paradox
of course global warming nowadays is far more extreme and it's causes have been well documented
lol look at jack being all pc
both terms are correct and you are wrong
people say climate change because global warming is apparently too ebay
scary*
caps lock means i win this argument
yes i'm aware of that difference jack.
as you should be aware it's completely irrelevant
no climate change refers to changing climates, not the overall increase in the earth's surface temperature. climate change = california's drought and rising sea levels in florida, global warming = increasing average global temperature.
do you read this shit before you type it? your whole argument is about semantics, and you're still wrong. yes, climate change takes into account temperature changes, but those can either increase or decrease. it doesn't look at the rising global average (at least directly). that's my point.
anyhoo this is dumb. peace bitch
no it clearly states that the two terms refer to separate but related phenomena. by your logic climate change should more accurately be considered part of global warming, since changing climates are a side effect of global warming
no, not at all. climate change does not lead to global warming
climate change is the result of global warming
some climates get hot, done get cold, some get dry, some get wet. all of that is happening because the world as a whole is getting warmer, which disrupts the delicate balance of all its environments.
climate change = changing climates... why is that so difficult to understand?
my god... but the beard is the source of his strength! it sustains him!
it's sexual.
anything going on at 509 tonight?
the things you watch...
david where you at?
who is amber?!?
and which will?
i exclusively wear letters when i poop
really any time my pants are off i'm probably wearing letters
dude he's about to shotgun a beer
i will shit on your chest.
your father may or may not pee sitting down
sorry, giving you guys freebes
your father may or may not spend considerable time shitting on the chests of others
your father may or may not have had sexual relations in the oval office
god dammit jacob. and cookie. i love you both. 
unconditionally.
his shoes are off. you guys must undergo the same treatment now.
although schlager is obviously the best fam
i can't help it that i'm right
and better than you all
aaron, that's because of how many people you reject, not accept
which is why malibu is doomed
i will fight every hot damn
at the same time
uh i really have no idea
sorry bud, i'm in ohio right now and can't check >_<
so osu's campus is waaaaayyy cooler than iu's.
what's the difference?
oohhhh, jordan you mean just pledge rides, especially dittmer
gotcha.
(you'll always be a pledge to me dittmer :d)
not yet. will soon
dittmer, i will skull fuck you senseless.
i'll rip off your head and shit down your neck.
i'll slit your throat and fuck you through it.
and then i'll shit on your chest.
will go
you mean like 50% of all his messages ever?
doesn't liking  your own messages mean the opposite of that jordan?
in other news, lucas your bag is not in my car

he had his shoes on!
not in my recording
stfu pledge
im saying those are the time
rules*
dude, look up at the picture will just posted
 shoes are on
fucking pledges man
this picture is from the recording i took. note the shoes. you other mother fuckers are the ones who did things to shoe-less lucas
not anymore
and dude, hornung does that shit all the time so i don't want to hear it
i love you all. take your damn shoes off though.
lol, good one
hahahaha
wow that's quite a statement will
oh shit. i'm inbound.
or can you save some for me?
condoms suck dude.
but are a necessary evil
yo, are we doing outdoors stuff today??
will and loren and i*
seriously?
what is joke?
nice!
yup! you down to meet in 30?
holy fuck daredevil on netflix is graphic
just saw daredevil cauterize a dying man's wound with a flare so that he could interrogate him before he bled out
aww shit yeah
pretty much the same thing i feel about making consensual love to a beautiful woman
soon, young one. i've got to focus on grad school stuff
yo david i'm at wright
<3 you
alright man i'm just hanging out by the teter nst
glean* not gleam
bros... remind me when olympics are?
friday or saturday?
describe it to me so i can fap
what dittmer said
