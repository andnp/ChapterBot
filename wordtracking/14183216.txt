1) if you're interested in adpi's philanthropy, let me know soon so i can get magaldi money
2) hannah told me she is selling kappa delta tanks so if you want one let me know. i'll have pictures and prices soon, but i know we all love kd
3) bailey told me phi mu's philanthropy is coming up. i'll have dates and more soon, just thought i'd get that out there because i know we also love phi mu and i think more of you who met bailey also liked her.
once i get dates and prices and stuff i'll put it in announcements, but i thought i'd give you all a heads up for now
i'm going for sure.
april 18. details were just put in announcements

haha if you're lucky, will 😁
people donated this year. its just hard to ask people to pay to sign up and ask for money. not everyone is comfortable doing that. which is how it's going to be again this year.
to simplify aaron's point: andy is love. andy is life
(for lucas) it's all andy now
it's cause he's "se-xist"
congrats! that's awesome!

this just in: looking for new father. do not want taylor  hornung as father anymore..
tonight at 8, the whit is playing "unfriended" which isn't in the theaters yet if anyone wants to go
livin life on the edge. i guess
ugh too much dbz to catch up in
on
have you guys seen the live action dbz about gohan and trunks in the future with the androids??
also, krillin is such a huuuuge fuckin bitch. but damn, that hair he grew 😏
okay. stepping on a cricket would send goku into an unstoppable murder frenzy..
http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_characters_killed_by_goku
one of the best fights of the series, imo
okay, so i'm reading a thread about why goku is overrated. and someone stats gohan is stronger than goku because he defeated cell. but if you remember, goku decided to stop fighting so gohan could, right? he def could have won
supposed to. but in the end, goku was definitely superior due to his perseverance and fighting skills
still counts in murders
also, i'd like to say one word that describe something more useless than krillin:
yamcha
also, goku in god mode. that's all
that fuckin movie
have you signed up...
mounted brentwood tonight

that being said, formal chapter at 7pm in the oak room
which was, without a doubt, the best hint there has ever been.
you also asked me, in the middle of us talking and hints going on, what we were doing. i saiddad's night and you got so excited and were so surprised. it was wonderful.

we look so big!
april 14 (tuesday) at 7pm
