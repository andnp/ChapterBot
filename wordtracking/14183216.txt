1) if you're interested in adpi's philanthropy, let me know soon so i can get magaldi money
2) hannah told me she is selling kappa delta tanks so if you want one let me know. i'll have pictures and prices soon, but i know we all love kd
3) bailey told me phi mu's philanthropy is coming up. i'll have dates and more soon, just thought i'd get that out there because i know we also love phi mu and i think more of you who met bailey also liked her.
once i get dates and prices and stuff i'll put it in announcements, but i thought i'd give you all a heads up for now
i'm going for sure.
april 18. details were just put in announcements
"done" - hannah klipsch, march 31, 15. 11:05pm
good luck convincing the good, christian girl to that ;)
i'll have prices soon 👍
i think they're fresh out of those because kd's are nice ladies 😍
haha if you're lucky, will 😁
people donated this year. its just hard to ask people to pay to sign up and ask for money. not everyone is comfortable doing that. which is how it's going to be again this year.
to simplify aaron's point: andy is love. andy is life
(for lucas) it's all andy now
it's cause he's "se-xist"
congrats! that's awesome!
most of us agree caymen can't come back if he's drinking
there was a dead mouse in a ceiling tile! haha
1
oak room. 7pm
soooo just reevaluate your drink choice...?
❤️brennan❤️
it sounded like her was, but he was actually asking about when we give clues
he*
hey! i'll work on it....
bit? 😂
yeah, i'll blow  someone for an entire roadtrip if they write my questions for me
the world would thank you
no, basically is. 😷😷😷
schlagger, pretty soon 😂

i'm leaving
knowledge really can be power

hold up. when did friday become a rush event...?
this just in: looking for new father. do not want taylor  hornung as father anymore..
tonight at 8, the whit is playing "unfriended" which isn't in the theaters yet if anyone wants to go
livin life on the edge. i guess
ugh too much dbz to catch up in
on
have you guys seen the live action dbz about gohan and trunks in the future with the androids??
also, krillin is such a huuuuge fuckin bitch. but damn, that hair he grew 😏
okay. stepping on a cricket would send goku into an unstoppable murder frenzy..
http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/list_of_characters_killed_by_goku
one of the best fights of the series, imo
okay, so i'm reading a thread about why goku is overrated. and someone stats gohan is stronger than goku because he defeated cell. but if you remember, goku decided to stop fighting so gohan could, right? he def could have won
supposed to. but in the end, goku was definitely superior due to his perseverance and fighting skills
still counts in murders
also, i'd like to say one word that describe something more useless than krillin:
yamcha
also, goku in god mode. that's all
that fuckin movie
have you signed up...
mounted brentwood tonight
amber to will: where are you from?
will: compton
amber: where's that?
wi: it's east of bloomington

amber believed him...
amber is who we're visiting. and jettinghoff 
sleeping beauty at her job making money 💵

#andysteepee

definitely me and andy 😂
everyone is gone
that's fucking awesome! i'm excited that my fucking lightweight of a son didn't die.
schlager = dying fambam
#riseofthebarbies
cookie ill fucking bake you
i told you, it's my goal of the semester: see how many cookie jokes i can make
quantity does not drive quality. have you seen some of the bigger frats?! #atblow
rt cookie.
laundry on my bed = cory waking up in the morning to find me passed out on the couch in my underwear #noshame
that being said, formal chapter at 7pm in the oak room
which was, without a doubt, the best hint there has ever been.
you also asked me, in the middle of us talking and hints going on, what we were doing. i saiddad's night and you got so excited and were so surprised. it was wonderful.
haunting, table for 1 please 👍
we look so big!
april 14 (tuesday) at 7pm
minutes will start getting sent to email with listserv. when doubt, it's in box
that's valid, but the parking for this is through the city of bloomington, right?
wyatt's coming back to iu 😳
that was my first thought 😅
i don't care
what games we doing?
sounds good
late notice, and i don't know how many actually want one, but hannah wants to get money for kd tanks tomorrow and wants you people to get one. so if you want one, contact me and i'll pick up your money sometime tomorrow.
$12
thanks for the reminder, i'll do that now
drunk, passed out lucas pics are my favorites! 
ha. whatever you say lucas. we'll find out on tuesday 😂
are you trying to say he was asking for it because he has his shoes on...?
i'll take the whole box
ahhhh i was wondering who would make the joke 😂
patrick and matt have signed up for iudm! the sooner you sign up, the more time you have to raise money! keep it up guys, i'm already i excited for iudm!
everyone should adopt that attitude like will! if everyone just set out to impress me, the would be a better place and our chapter would probably have a waitlist for membership and 4 mansions 💁
the world would be*
wait, was that question at me, lucas?
i'm fine with it as long as he isn't overly drunk
yeah, it's beer olympics, so he needs to drink haha. just not overly drunk 😋
love it
i'll take it
what time is the meeting tomorrow
i honestly don't see a reason to. it doesn't have anything giving the olympics an affiliation. 
you get even more with mason
not my fault, homedawg. not my snapchat 😂
hahahahahaha it was a joke 😂
cause she has jungle fever and me and the other guy are clearly white 😁

eat a biscuit for me 😭
😂😂😂
with the amount that takes to get him drunk, he could only pay $2
but we're gonna fucking work on this shit, ben.
and also something you'll accomplish fairly easily 😂
midwest, all of the usa, same difference
8:15 homies
ahhhhhhh kay

ugh i lost track of time
we have to figure out about if we have to remove them first
we have super smash balls
box of condoms with our letters on them... good or bad for discussion? maybe not the best place 😂
ugh, mason with his valid arguments...
what about a black shirt...?
fair, but by the time we get back and have the shirts it'll be beginning of september, right? however, i do agree with your point.
oh, hey. never mind✌️
i prefer fall rush over f. rush by a lot. f. rush isn't necessarily clear, and it can also be taken as a meaning if "eff rush". 
love the front though. however, not a fan of having fall rush 2015 on the front and back.
cookie, i love you but you're not acting like that in here. contribute positively to social service or leave.
