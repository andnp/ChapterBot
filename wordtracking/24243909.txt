hi
i agree with that completely it seems much less forced.
true especially if the pnm decided they didn't want to sign then the brother gets screwed
i agree 
i was actually just typing that jefe. yeah i would feel  bad if i found out later on
yeah i agree with you on that that will. don't just drop it but don't tell it is "required"
real talk. 
ï¿½ nice it's all good
i got this. chatting people up is right up my alley
yeah i agree jeff. 
yeah like the day they are at the rush event we can decide in the groupme like we did with ben
#sniped'em
if you attempt, i say it's fair game. 
if you like then enough to look for confirmation you can probably trust a brother's best judgment 
i think there is one at the mall ;)
lol sorry i'll just leave
what is candle pass?
guys remember there's a rush event tomorrow! it's gonna be one of the last ones so we should make it one of the best! 7pm at 509

why don't we just oil ourselves up. i don't know how it will help rush but it sounds fun. 
we all have a little commie in us.

hi iris
 also drop the fall rush back @jeffrey slaven 
i actually like that one better 
i like fall rush now actually 
nah make it cause car accidents from being so bright yo. 
lol jeff has you covered
i prefer orange.
try a duller orange for the base shirt? 
make a cultural reference? rush kdr: work hard, play hard
that's dope
lol so that with the rush kdr front?
that and jeff's back?
will's last one and jeff's last one. 
the front is good 
needs words on the back. it seems empty
hmm.. do you want a 70s one or a general one?
lemme think on it
hmm maybe maybe... what about "peace, love, and brotherhood"
true... 
idk i like that back but yeah not too good for rush. and damn that's a good deal. 
"party like the good old days"
