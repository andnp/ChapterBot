dude jordan, i will seriously eat jewish food with you any day. 
100% down 
are people coming to chapter tonight or?
can i get someone to proxy at joint gavel tonight? 8pm oak room tonight
super easy: pretty much just have to show up, listen and jot down anything that seems notable? i have to work on a russian project and tonight is like the only night i can work on it 
is that a no on the proxy? if you're thinking about a leadership position, this is a great opportunity to learn about the holistic greek system 
that's good because the eli will also be here 
i really love all of you guys, but sometimes i really hate all of you 
"formal" attire. no ritual. 
i feel like people get brent and brennan mixed up for random things all the time and i don't get it all. they are nothing alike jabs 
my phone keeps correcting "haha" to jabs and i also don't get that
magaldi constantly mixes brent and brennan up
also, i have never mixed up aaron and andy haha. once again totally different people 
atta boy jeffry 
❤️
indeed 
good point; i didn't even think of that. 
does anyone remember where we told alumni to park last year at 400?
