oh no... cookie is typing... *cowers*

i guess i need to have sex with them to find out. 
i've seen a couple 
no, you deserve that one. 
you were asking the important questions 
i'm crying right now 
really? 
that needs to stop cookie...we have sam in that group 
no, probably not. we get it from nationals 
that's what i've been doing 
it's still just as fucking stupid as always 
you could have probably thought up better shit than what was put in here, and had a much better laugh. 
i'd like to point out, i said "probably" 
pissed 
why would we add more to an already long enough test? 
we should talk about it at chapter 
good idea though 
we can give them a badge 
why do we have discussions at 11:30? 
i'll catch up later. too much work. 
whoever made these impromptu plans should be botw

the plans were made quickly, mostly because i have to go to a state park for a class. 
i took it into account and didn't care, cuz grades lol
can confirm. advisory isn't happy 
for the overnight we should have a fire!!! 
no brothers only. .  wtf 
there are vaginas here 
for once can we have an actual brother only event?! you kidding me? 
mason's butt is much cuter than that 
no
i don't even know where i am! how can you know!?!?! i could be literally anywhere 
fuck that zac kid!!! 
he ain't good enough for us! 
*cough i met the owner before you* /flex he also gave me $20 so i'm awesome. (just wanted to one up someone) 
i met jesus, so i'm better 
he is white, and speaks english. 
yeah that fucking picture is awesome and deserved more likes!!!! 
bask in the warm glow of my humble awesomeness!!! also.... suck my dick
hey, how about you spend two hours searching for pictures on facebook and cutting them to the right size for a tiny head in a completely different medium!!!
i'll probably get drunk and do it at some point... 
now we have too many brothers to post on that painting... 
don't worry, advisory will delay the rules and work on kicking out brothers. nationals will understand 
idk what photoshop even is. 
so no one wants to be pontifex? that's what that activity told me
i hate all of you. 
hahhaha april fools!!!! you guys got pranked so hard!!! 
sean, that picture could have gotten tons of likes with better lighting!!!! 
okay... well, will, mason, or topher. you could have gotten a bunch of likes if blah blah blah 
oh yeti or whatever the iphone only app is called 
on*
we have done it.... 
regardless they have one of the most famous iu alumnus as a brother... 
i never said that
i mean... ayn rand is an interesting read.
that's illegal and we don't do that... unless the individuals partaking are 21
i'll just drink it all for you
reverend pontifex to you pleb! 
brennan.... you have just given me a life goal 
little 5... i shall drink an entire 5th of everclear in an evening.
start taking bets if i survive or not 
bank on it! 
i'll just drive myself 
actually, my dreams were just crushed by the internet. i'd die with 10 shots 
my bac would be. 4
that means at least coma
i gotta do it quick then
don't crush my dreams sean!!! some people wanna be big shot sports broadcasters, some wanna drink a lot of everclear!!! 
so that's means you're gonna join? 
toooooo the mooooooooon!!!! 
and everyone else!!!!! nerd!!! 
and will, people actually have that as a home unit 
well it doesn't cost as much as you'd think. (this is of course opinion) 
i have a couple friends with them in their homes. they are neat 
don't disgrace my favorite band will
that's why he'll talk to us!!!! 
uhhh... i like literally every song by them.... but if the chapter starts listening to them then i'll have to find a new indie band 
... do you not know how indie folk music works!?!?! 
i own more... but i won't bring that to attention 
but they don't!!!! like they play the same songs!!!! until recently 
i have!!!! 
i don't think you understand
no. like i've owned their shit since castaways and cutouts was a thing. like i've been sacking their dicks from the beginning 
i said it as i was typing 
yeah, i'd do that to colin meloy
you will learn what a good prof is layer on time 
later*
that accurately describes how i fell 
feel
420-666-6969
fuck him in his rotting corpse!! 
rich white men that wear new balance shoes and turtlenecks
he did, i talk to him everyday 
does*
but i think we can all  agree that joseph smith spoke to god and is a prophet  
let's go to red lobster 
thank god!!! 
also, thank yahweh
no!!! the original language was 'murican!!! 
jesus spoke english, was white, likes chick fil a, and likes the beach boys. 
dude, jesus would be doing peyote with joe rogen... 
why would believe in a place you wouldn't go to anyway? 
that's why i don't belive in nebraska 
yeah... can confirm not accurate
no you right l cakes
i feel like this could be offensive 
i'm pretty sure that's what happened lakes 
l cakes 
i'm pretty sure chuck norris and bob saget were hanging out,  and they just put a bunch of stuff in a box and threw it down the stairs of some frat house and then made the universe. 
no. 
(in response to hornung)  i spread my cheeks for andy 
well gravity is in space... 
there is a point i'd make, but idk how to accurately and efficiently type it out....  so i'll send this instead. 
well lucas says you're stupid will
well the world population is fucked!!! 
it's pretty neat 
i'll show those math fagits 4d!!!
sooo... there is a sean that actually did more than think about a math major! 
i hate graphs... they can be manipulated so easily to influence people 
i'd imagine no... 
i just don't think that this issue can be explained and demonstrated with just a line graph 
what are words? 
all i gathered from that article was motivation and education are important... 
there is a book literally dedicated to that
http://www.amazon.com/how-lie-statistics-darrell-huff/dp/0393310728
that doesn't seem like a simple random sample... 
there is so much bias here... i think i just got cancer 
we need to ask the important questions!!! 
okay, so new topic: how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
sean there isn't gravity in space!!!! 
he actually is ignoring me... 
nvm 
aaron gets it
i got dr.dre
i understand, i'm generally sarcasm free 
we're gonna fight will
and i just can't wait to be king!!!! 
the snow glows white on the mountain tonight 
what's the internet? 
i thought it was gore
like,  al gore
gave the wrong young niggas money 
if you think about it, we're all just made up of tiny vibrating strings... 
the beach boys were thinking of string theory before it was cool 
so i'll meet you there 
copa
cops 
i was seeing what the word was
act like you bubs harder than us!!! 
fuckin one pound after cook weight!!!

#andriodmasterrace
universal expansion also brings out really neat theories!!! 
yeah, if you bring up certain words insta kick 
fucking expanding so much to where the universe splits or rubber bands back into an infinitely dense particle 
for wut? 
that's illegal 
it's not as good as light energy 
and light mater 
and they should be kept separate (light and dark matter) 
can you imagine if the big crunch is real?!? how many times has the universe done it!?!?!?! 
time is neat...
i know what's down there...  mole people 
damn... 
tell all of your classes to #rushkdr
fighting isn't about numbers!!! it's about heart! it's about the strength of the bond between our brothers!!! it's about who the craziest mother fuckers are!!!!!! hot damn! 
how many colors of armies are in risk? 
okay, so tomorrow (i realize it's after a social event) myself, taylor h, and mason are heading to mccormick's creek at like 1. i have to go for a class, so i'm not rescheduling. anyone is free to come with us. it isn't supposed to rain, and it should be a perfect day. if you wanna go be at 509 at one. 
and it won't be an all day endeavor. if you wanna watch iu not play basketball, idc. 
"no, fuck you lucas" 
work.... since 9am
okay, the downstairs was just officially locked, by me. i did feel comfortable with it being open.  i am sorry! if it's fucked up, i can fix 
just cuz the party stopped doesn't mean we stopped!!!! 
#startsrave
in one hour imma leave for mccormick's cre
ek
okay, at 1pm taylor hornung and i are going to mccormick's creek. all are welcome! let me know if you wanna come with us
you are a fiend!!! 
a monster!!! 
... for a sec i thought those were boobs. i'm a broken man
it's rite naow!?!! 
no. and that isn't something we discuss. 
it's a bonfire! 
i mean... sean. you're young 
5*
reading the group after not checking it for a few hours. 
sooo... when do questions start? 
like do we have a time? 
that's illegal, none of us do that 
? 
buy another hard drive. terabyte hard drives aren't toooo expensive anymore 
i keep a backup just in case the internet blows up or something. always nice to have porn available 
also, a new terabyte internal hard drive would only be like $50 on newegg
idk about ps4 technology. i am about as knowledgeable as my grandmother when it comes to consoles (especially sony) 
and my grandmother is dead... 
i guess what i'm trying to say is, i don't know 
i didn't look it up. i'm just assuming prices cuz that's what i paid for and the market for hard drives has been stable for awhile. 
i gave advice for a computer... 
but after a quick google search, the only requirements for a hard drive for a ps4 is 
2.5 inch hdd
9.5mm tall
sata connection
excuse me? 
nope
�
i also enjoy r/oddlysatisfying 
r/spacedicks
aaron go
raw fish and hard liquor.... nope can't see an issue. 
saturday sucks dick! friday is wayyyy better 
nerd! 
we could get those kd tanks and just write rho on them with sharpie! 
they would look great!!!! 
act like you don't want this tank!!!! 
can confirm. data is good
it wasn't actually ever a "test word"  it was in fact two words not spaced out 
i literally just snapped that idea when you sent that! 
uhh... actually if you went to chapter you know that he is on social probation till this weekend 
i've had my money in my desk for awhile now,waiting for you to show up to a chapter 
text me with your concerns. it is much better than groupme 
but you weren't, and not here. i'm done 
you have my number 
peter they have been back!!!! 
did you go in and spread the kdr love!?!?! 
aaron is pretty much correct! as long as it isn't fighting words, it's free game and protected. i'd like to throw in that legality does not equate to ethical. (which i'm sure we all agree with that this is unethical)  just my thoughts. 
i know you weren't mason, i was just adding unimportant information and opinions to aaron's post.

cuz i make dem bitches wet 
dude!!!! i run a spot light for that show! 
i fracking hate tech week... i can't do anything fun
1st freeza sucks, not even a cool villain. 2nd gt's story line was god awful. i wanted to die the entire time, and at the end literally nothing changes. 
and his brother cooler is the biggest loser of all time. 
no... he got fucked up by people who aren't even main characters... 
also, side note, phones do not like the word, " frieza" 
no... krillin is a bitch 
goku is evil for not killing him 
krillin had soooo many opportunities to be badass... and fucked it up 
goku totally kills niggas... let me watch the series real quick 
not even true! 
he killed a human!!! grandpa gohan!! 
before dragonball. he lost control of the ape and killed someone 
like the red ribbon army! 
fucking shit, goku is a psychopath!! 
not quite true... 
in fact... not at all
goku can destroy the world just by charging up his power 
a spirit bomb literally sucks the life force of everything on the god damn plannet!!! 
broly doesn't count. 
he actually is a god 
 also... one more thing about krillin, his discs have an impact (conservatively) 1 out of 11 times 
gohan was given special power from a god to go mythic. 
so gohan, given more power by a super being will be the most powerful (technically not fused) character 


hey jordan are you enjoying magic flute? and the amazing spotlights? 
the magic flute...
first mistake, not getting the new note.

that's a pretty good picture of me there aaron 

they parked on the road. 
what time are we starting?

is there a way we could try and shove them in the driveway? 
also, the bloomington website says that only one visitor permit can be purchased per address. 
i just can't believe there  isn't a way to host a gathering before 5pm or on weekends. (with your guests being able to park) 
i'm stoked 
or have a constant watch on the street looking for city police.
so it'll just seem like forever 
chief, what's a... ummm..  a "penis?"
