fuck those alumni.
he left two hours ago.
i think you don't know what mental retardation is.
too butt hurt to be politically correct.
calendar says oak room.
i'll jog with you peter.
asians can't be in a sorority.
no, we're going to hike and play frisbee and stuff.
yep. this saturday.
i'll be there soon!!
cold.
loren, remember that zach kid that you were obsessed with? yeah he rushed pike.
notre dame is giving uk all it can handle!! watch if you aren't!!
so fucking close. damn.
but the ppr...
getting close to that offensive stuff we were talking about in chapter. let's calm it down.
let's just keep anything related to religion out of all groups. and loren that was addressed at chapter so please shut the fuck up.
no harm done, let's just all play nice and by the rules.
people will like each other a lot more if ^^that's the way it works!
we could make a composite of only embarrassing photos of each brother.
post the skidmore one too.
worst... problem... ever.
7:30.
i'm about to send a list of all our social events for the rest of the year to luke. then proceed to ask him for theirs.
three of us are at study tables.
saturday's event is a cookout/bonfire/everything else.
friendly reminder fellow gents, straight out of the pathfinder!
they also weren't founded this year. they were reinstated. and their nationals are pretty good to kickstart involvement.
people are aware because of chapter, and they will participate if they want. no need to mud up the groupme about it now.
and now it's not even kdr related. let's dissipate the conversation.
nope.
also nope.
hi.
let's just leave it to us.
solid.
the real question is, is iris attractive?
i'm dtf.
wait... i'm in a relationship... i can't say that.
so is the life of #tequilawednesday
you didn't lol......

read carefully.
especially since issues like that are so easy to solve either by way of the exec committee or just someone individually going out to make sure the problem isn't a problem.
and its *sport communication.
it's also *it's.
unfortunately no.
a lot of the classes overlap, so that's why.
me too. i might be doubling in sport comm and journalism if my advising meeting goes well.
wasn't he real in judaism? just not seen as the savior?
interesting. did not know that.
i mean there was probably at one point in the history of the world someone named jesus... probably.
red lobster is one tasty establishment.
i actually really want red lobster now.
i know where it is! hahaha
i'm leaving... :(
yeah fuck that aaron guy!
that actually is a really fun fact.
i like that this conversation is actually informative about stuff. whilst joking around is still happening!
will were you raised catholic?
and loren the debbie downer.
people also used to believe that the earth was flat. science very well could be wrong.
but by that logic, every religion could be wrong too, so no one really knows i guess.
that's assuming that humans and other things are as complex as they get. there could be way more complex shit out there.
i think this could be used as a direction tool. so say hornung is confused and doesn't know where to go, we help him find it. something like that sound about right?
unless i also am confused in which case don't listen to me. hahaha
let's not talk about that. i hate sports.
to play devils advocate, we probably wouldn't be living somewhere that couldn't sustain life. so we gotta live somewhere.
by play i by no means am saying that i am the devils advocate. that would be bad. please don't burn me at the stake.
so if what i'm gathering is correct: math is the single most important major and everyone should follow andy's example and major in it.
actually yes it is. because the light that you are seeing from the sun is 7 seconds old. so it would work the same way if you were really far away, only way more seconds.
but we've seen microorganisms on other planets before. if they were far enough away, that could cause some confusion on our end.
that is also a fun fact.
so in summation: we're all going to die and none of this matters.
i would imagine not because it's an average.
you know what's a cool theory? multiverse theory. that boggles my mind.
at least in one universe or another you are guaranteed to not suck!
imagine how different a universe could be if you made one decision differently. like going to class today v. skipping. nuts.
exactly!!
see now i never need a reason to skip class!
however that 100 number could be shifted over time. like 100 now could not be 100 100 years ago.
right, so people could be getting dumber, just iq cannot be a good indicator of that.
something tells me sean has figured this out before.
woodchuck stuff.
how much wood could it chuck?
scroll up.
yeah don't put us on yik yak. risky stuff there.
lucas: okay, so new topic: how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
he's trolling.
never gonna give you up! never gonna let you down!
✋
the conversation flow is phenomenal today.
as long as everything is fipg safe, terminology doesn't really matter.
he must have hit one of the hot words.
loren please don't re-add people. it is under andy or taylor's discretion to add them back.
honestly not sure.
we should just not talk about those things in here anyway. that's probably why its a hot word.
well that's really not your call. it's andy's.
actually no. if it is stuff involving risk, technically it's mine. so just stop.
also, wtf will m.
that's really cool.
there's a whole other world below us too. think about how complex the sewer system is and what all could be living down there.
or oceanic.
i has table.
in the middle, more toward the group study rooms.
iris, help me learn to groupme.
dammit iris.
you suck.
they are. recall andy's candle pass about needing to overcome addictions, like cheerios.
i think that's definitely manageable, but they should also not be afraid to reach out to exec or other people to help. because it is a chapter thing, not just them.
there are people we could contact. i'm sure skidmore has those peoples information.
their director of risk would be a good person. not sure who it is though.
well there you go.
if taylor gives me more information about the specifics of the event, i would gladly contact him.
agreed.
i think it would make sense for me to, but i im not super protective over the duties. hahaha
be safe everyone!
i'll second it.
the hostility is real. calm down young ones!
are you chief lennon now?
left just in time to not see the real answer...
what a terrible son.
says the jaeger.
if you count what you do as "around". haha and jordan you forgot andy.
yaaaaaas bitches!
sean- "hey daddy look at this meme i created!"

loren- "that's terrible son."
naww, his spawn are doing all the work for him.
to be precise april 1, 2013.
it's only gone downhill since sean decided to break away.
taylor got hit in the testicles will be late. 
not after saturday.
hey, his major is hard work.
that's because i already have one.
now that sean and i aren't the same major i'm going to give him so much shit.
just landed an internship for next school year!

me trying to get home before the rain starts.
i am so excited for dads night.
10. but show up at 9 so we can start coming up with questions!
agreed with jeff. this is why you're vp of management! haha
easy as throwing it in the groupme. if the end result is them getting a bid, the dinner isn't as much an issue.
i like that i'm not even leading the conversation. it's mostly jeff and pat taking over. and i love that.
beat me to it pat. haha
i think we get the people at the event to agree, i say it's cleared.
let's be real though, no one outside of rush committee is going to want to give out bids.
true. however, didn't we say that a pnm needed to come to a rush event to get bidded?
well put guys. i will update the minutes if no one else has any more input!
any other hot topics we want to hit?
iris add todo: discuss where events will be held next year.
candlepass is a chance where every brother gets to say anything they want without being interrupted. in pledge order.
we all get in a circle and become really cult-like.
and apparently iris is asleep...
the past few candlepasses have been really positive. the few before that were just bitchfests.
no, andy said she's asleep.
i love that all of these new guys are so motivated and excited! especially jeff. he's ready to be a leader like now.
agreed. i think i'm going to give him his first task as vp of comm. ramp up the excitement about the event and get brothers to come to it.
thanks iris!
damn... shit got real. can we like... date?
you know where i sleep.
she's welcome to join obviously.
this is not something that the whole chapter should be involved in discussing. it is between dan and advisory.
we should play truth or drink this weekend.
well, that is a first amendment right as long as you aren't insulting a particular person. that that i'm defending racism. hahaha
ethics do not equal law. we just covered this in media law yesterday. hahaha
no i know. haha i'm just spitting out gibberish. like most of the time.
we're just toward the back at a table.
really wasn't expecting all that bullshit to happen from that simple concept. skidmore is really adamant about not requiring anything from his chapter isn't he?
what if god created the universe as not brand new, so our science would make it seem like it's old, but he's really just testing our faith?
will, the definition of hazing is so general that people who don't like fraternities can basically spin anything that they do in a way that it becomes hazing. it becomes a little ridiculous sometimes.

one source is good enough right dr jettinghoff?
you know i'm just trolling right?
and the dioxide.
what was the right answer to the question i wonder. science?
again, trolling. haha
that's alright man! it happens!
working on their project. so adorable.
can someone pick up paper towels for tonight?
shouldn't need to say it, but just in case: don't wear letters.
this is the not safe for work group! feel free to circle jerk all you want!
yaaaaas!
did he have his shoes on though?
so they broke the rules? bastards.
oh wait that's me.
i fucking love every single one of you.
i fix.
lol, size matters.
pats not a barbie!
quantity drives quality!
bang bang.
well obviously.
ashton boys make it back safe?
can confirm.
oak.
ashton.
california state fullerton.
i'm fine with that. hornung can handle it.
do not mention dads night at chapter!!!
they usually are just because they were all undergrads not too long ago, so they get what goes on. but i agree, ben is very kdr. haha
the beginnings of a draft.
i knew that.
...
incorrect will. brent is.
if you notice the entire last row and a half is this year brothers. hahaha
so many people do it. but they only call me andy. not vice versa.
5, but i'm sure if more go that is certainly ok!
holy shit it worked.
sweet. good job!
we should recruit smart people.
will iris ask a time if you don't include it in your when statement?
maybe. that would make it an easier step by step thing. because i guarantee someone will put just the day. also, am and pm could be an issue.
but maybe because 3 am has already passed. try another day.
can i try?
iris please add an event for me.
test #3
wednesday at 5
neat-o!
it's so weird that kdr literally lived out of ashton for a few years. i love it.
iris add todo.
no, add todo
what a bitch.
iris can you add a todo?
no
iris, add todos
iris, add todo
noooooooooo
iris, add todo
really will?
iris add todo
yes
discuss phired up recruitment ideas.
april 18.
iris get todos
no
iris get todos recruitment
social had 1:00 on the minutes
really doubt we could fit more than 2 cars in the drive
correct.
iris, say eornfosdnfskdqpw.
right. and we already have two....
^^ that's more what i was thinking.
how late is this going to run? if it'll run into the evening it'll stop being an issue after 5.
he's coming back for his doctorate.
men's race is saturday. and its about 2 hours
you recallarino correctly!
so one of the ideas for rush in the fall that ben leahy gave me was storm the dorm. basically what we do is during welcome week have different groups of people spend a few hours in different dorms, meeting all the freshmen they can. then when they look for people to hang out with, were there to invite them out to our welcome week rush event. who wants to do it?
they don't want anyone involved in that process. not just fraternity guys.
is that because manchester is where i'm from? then i get to punch people? i understand the game now.
2014 on the left, 2015 on the right. we did a pretty good job with recruitment this year. thanks everyone.
the dorm storm would be a pretty easy way to bend those rules.
ben talked with the sll advisor today. she said we can't do that.
we could easily take a poker set in. or we can drag them out of the dorms to play frisbee. go in for 20 minutes collecting people and then meeting back up with people to play.
who would know the difference? we could easily get in. even if it just took one person getting permission.
you're right. ben also suggested turkey bowling. set up a slip and slide with vegetable oil. set up two liters at the end, and literally bowl a frozen turkey down the slide.
would be about $50-70 though...
will?
ah i see.
i'll send out a link to phired up's list of potential events when i get home.
accurate.
phired up is a company that gives advice for recruitment for fraternities and sororities.
do it.
still gotta get that 75% doh!
http://bit.ly/1fiva5x here is the link for those phired up events.
i always get so excited when i read phired up ideas.
*hahaha
"taylor... where are we right now?"
"we're at dads night. giving clues right now."

"aww shit yeah!!"
-lucas 1992-2015
he was saying it before he was born.
iris, can you add a todo for me?
yes
discuss the six cylinders of phired up.
april 23.
not this semester, but he might in the fall once he is self sufficient from a financial standpoint.
we extended him a bid. lives in eigenmann.
that was matt lyng or thompson. not entirely sure.
everyone cool with meeting at the house this week? i would like kleine to be there for it.
cayman is not allowed. no questions asked.
way to use social media!
bid em? hahaha
how did you find these people?
so you're a creeper. cool.
like we're not a biking fraternity. just trying to rebuild.
this is at the house for whoever owns it.
�
what for?
was it jeanette?
can you send me a link to said photo?
the journalist in me says that is one awful caption.
not just because i'm not in it, but that doesn't help matters.
oh seriously it does. and notice they have brysen listed as an "undergraduate board of director". that makes literally no sense. he can't be a board.
i'm actually strongly considering it. they all loved my little 500 article from last summer.
i might actually try to see if i can craft a future job for myself out of the national office. editor in chief of a national newsletter sounds pretty neat to me.
i can make it one.
no wonder the editing is horrendous.
i wonder if they have a director of media or something like that. that would be something right up my alley.
so is red lobster still happening?
i'll be there soon.
peter, we already went k ed this. hahaha
