i get really sad watching the little 500 tv promo with a kdr alumni being the first person in the commercial yet we don't have a team �
food for thought: is it possible to become so comfortable with your heterosexuality that you actually re-raise the question of your sexuality? 
sorry i'm playing catchup on this group.
for the record that photo was of down syndrome, not retardation. 
you could always just give a quiz on it.
so like peter or the acting jt would asses the quiz and then go over it question by question with pledges
i did not spell assess right, however i hope that the merciful taylor hornung will not kick me for accidentally typing in a swear word, as i was actually trying to be helpful for once


so....can i apply for a son?....peter?
i accept.

give it a fucking rest guys, friends have always been welcomed at brotangs
topher and i are going soonish
lucas isn't even in town...

bow down gentlemen



crossfit
so a possible example: get will dressed in native american attire, head dress, war paint, et al. and then a life size of him riding a noble white steed would be wonderful
wait mason are you seriously on yetti?
what's the event saturday?
where the fuck is everyone?
i didn't take any pics...
hahaha okay freshman
i am not taking you to the hospital
yeah there's 17 shots in it
nope. that's not how that works
i do both...
3 tucker maxs last year which is 9 shots of it...so yeah i gotta top it
tuesday is gonna ruin my little 5 week
why the actual fuck would someone post a video of themselves fucking on yeti?
yeeeeeeeeep. first it was fingering, then straight fucking on the next one
doughy.
i don't think so
dick was pretty small too
the belly screamed chubby
^hahaha so fucking wrong. 
yeah it's dumb. i wanted to double major in sport comm
and yes, there actually do different majors for it.
two...fuck steve jobs
fuck him and his awful view on modern medicine.
some view him as just another prophet, like the ones found in the old testament.
you haven't been to mexico, have you aaron?
spoiler: a lot of people named jesus in mexico.
that's the fundamental reason jewish people to recognize jesus. they were all like "what the fuck is the love your neighbor bullshit...smite our enemies you asshole." 
yes thank yhwh in this, the 2015th year of our lord. 
umm wrong jordan. his real name was jeebus. 
term you rarely hear: "in my time being a jew"
do jews believe in hell?
that's what i thought
well technically by definition, no afterlife would be hell
hell-complete separation from god.

...which means that if god doesn't exist we are actually in hell already. 
see we had it explained that purgatory was essentially a waiting room where you would suffer a small amount for your sins on earth and it'd be a time of reflection, before entering the kingdom of heaven.
then some fucknut teacher of mine tried telling us that you had to be prayed out of purgatory and i was like why the fuck would those in the afterlife have to rely on people still living 
you were taught wrong.
catching up: the ancient greeks used mathematics to determine that the earth was not flat.
will, the hierarchy the council of trent talks about refers to sainthood and i refuse to believe humans have any hand in determine how heaven works.
also loren there is a good chance that most extra terrestrial life will never be able to develop into more than micro organisms
no light years are measure of distance not time.
you idiots
if one of you idiots says there is no gravity space, i'm gonna kick you
in space 
jordan's people think he was too big of a pussy and want nothing to do with him 
jordan will you please confirm my last point
also thank you lucas
isn't it something like 1 in a trillion odds that two before have the same dna make-up? and that's assuming that the parents are the same every time
that should be people, not before....i'm really glad steve jobs is no longer around to see what shit the typing system on ios has become
not the same dna, so no
i can read titles of articles too, i'm a reddit pro brah
that last articles has two different answers on identical twins...
the world population is also higher than it has ever been which i'm sure plays some factor into that
yeah i meant in the sense of stretched resources 
don't come at me with knowledge you've gained over the last 6 years at a place of higher education 
right? the thought that there may be a slight differentiation of me based on even the smallest decisions i've made keeps me up at night. 
or am i thinking of something different than multiverse?
will, you know there is a reason why professors require more than one source typically right? i'm gonna set the same rule here. 
you could've been hit by a bus had you chosen to go to class
or met the girl of your dreams by happenstance 
had you gone
1. define common
2. i don't actually give a shit 
3. everyone has the ability to post the top result of google 
i saw that graph and was like "holy shit the average is gonna be brain dead" then i saw the labels
so basically what i'm gathering is that right now mental retardation is 65 on the iq scale, if that trend holds, that 65 could actually be considered today's "100" or average in a couple hundred years
so currently the average is 12 points lower than when the system was created? at least according to that article 
seriously, why the fuck do people have this muted. this conversation has been so engaging and so much better than the bullshit we usually spew here.
i need to know the mode
all hail mode
mode reveals all
using last night as the sample size:
i did not have sex. 
therefore i am an asexual person 100% of the time. 
there's a reason why black men like heavyset white women, their wide set vaginas can take their dicks. 
that's what your mom said to me last night will 
she appreciated the large sample size i left in her mouth will 
figured what out?
woodchuck stuff?
why is that relevant?
yes
mentioning any greek house on yik yak opens it up for bashing 
i don't know what i'm scrolling to
i did not see that, i try to avoid anything lucas does as much as possible
jack your new suit looked fly as fuck
there's no "technically" 
don't need him, i got dr. dash
straight outta compton
it's a crazy motherfucker named ice cube
from the gang called niggas with attitude 
when i'm called off
i got a sawed-off
squeeze the trigger 
and bodies are hauled off
the police are gonna have to come and get me off your ass
that's how i'm going out
for the punk motherfuckers that showing out
they like to mumble
mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
that was off the dome...am i black now?
haha i was on the internet in 2006 too aaron! high five!
and they sayin its because of the internet....
bae, where have you been?
schoolin these niggas 
got so many zeros they think i'm a dumby
unlike these other niggas man i'm really from atlanta 
i'm picking up good vibrations...
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
why did mason not get kicked?
is "partay" cool?
andy's the law
the big bad law
so what i've gathered from today is that we all need to get super high together and just discuss these deep topics
we could be living in a black hole and have no idea
the universe as we know it could happen to be what's on the other side of a black hole
haha such a weak house.
how about we have a war of houses, guarantee we win after next saturday 
*hits blunt* 
horses are just giant dogs you can ride
will if any hints are given during the car ride, i will kill you and loren will dedicate on your dear chest.
deficate*...and it was supposed to be dead, but i like the change
why would iphone change my word that was spelled correctly? 
hahaha (the person asking if he could give clues in the car is calling me stupid) okay freshman.
he literally went through it a few weeks ago...
who you calling young? i will shove you back up your greek mother's std-riddled cunt my beloved son. 
well, that's my fault more than anything
he was asking about the car earlier, right?
i'm pretty dumb, but i'm not blind.
the car is supposed to be a quiz for the actual test
also with 7 guys going through everyone needs to have 5 or 6 questions ready to go, no excuses to drop bullshit questions like hornung's classic "your father may or may not be your father" fucktard clue. 
your great-great grandmother may or may not have worked at night moves
may or may not jordan...no one can know for sure
perfect
also even when we tell them that they may have already guessed their father, it is completely within your right to continue to give bullshit clues
i already have a plan to break out the multiverse theory in a question so yall better bring your a game. 
you continue to be such a disappointment 
such a goddamn burden
hahaha okay freshman 
because jack is usually too drunk and dysfunctional to respond back and the rest of your family isn't at iu any more
but every single member of the new age of malibu is around 
ha in due time...we'll be the biggest family in a few days time 
what part of malibu barbies do you not understand 

oh sorry, i forgot #crownshit
sean-"daddy why don't you love me?"
loren-"because my son is taller than me."
.....okay so no one tell loren then.
it was an original house of nu that was resurrected by the visionary known as sean nash, circa 2013.
sean in his drunken and drug-fueled daze thought that being catholic gave him the right to play the role of jesus. 
sean initially thought that being given a ginger son was an april fools joke, he soon learned that the joke was actually on him.
 i was going to say it if he didn't...
you have redeemed yourself grandson

you spelled "dan" wrong
don't think so
your hopes lie in cookie and justin.
oh yes to be clear, i meant snyder a few texts ago.
i didn't want any confusion.
70 gb? 
yeah it was something like that on ps4
is said hard drive compatible with a ps4?
well i assumed you could read the production description and review...
so you're giving advice on something you've done absolutely no research on...dude you are so ready for a career in politics 
says the guy who has sent 8 straight messages to the discussion...

i love the new name maceface
hahaha okay old man
i don't see any of you trying find a job a month before graduation
go to bed aaron.
i mean i guess if you have went old men convince themselves is a real major
old men that*...remove the went
i'm fucked up.
well i won't be fucked up on air


aaron no
i would but id rather not watch a terrible movie 
well if watching a stupidly premised horror film is considered fun, then feel free to label me a hater. 
i will totally go storm chasing
okay, if you're not dead like this message so we can get a head count on who survived. 
if you're dead like this message. 
so to summarize: we have 12 confirmed dead, 5 both dead and alive, 9 unaccounted for and no pure survivors. 
okay so mason thinks he's cool and switched his dead/alive status, making him the only confirmed alive. which is cool with me, because i want him to be alone and sad.
you just want to be the new aaron so bad, don't you?

so we should rage for founders day 
lolz i just got some of those peter

i look at those 3 messages as one. it's the only time i like my own.
�
thank you aaron.
he could get that high though... if he did drugs, which he doesn't because they're illegal and should never be done.

i still find myself searching for the funny in that...
"i am not your father, take a drink!" 
"no lucas you're giving him a clue"
"that is my clue!"
check with chris maybe?
did you take the bag with you?
yeah except little 5 is next week
yeah...i don't record passed out people. i'm not a dick like lo lo.
and further more, the fine gentlemen that broke the rules of shoes off later in the night are going to get a large metal pole up their ass. 
yes, that gives you right to fuck
with him, not publicly post it. 
later in the night his shoes were off and people drew on him which is some gdi bullshit.
that's what i was referring to lo lo, you're just a dick for publicly shaming him. 
but i still luh you 😘
you were a snapchat video.
shut the fuck up jacob hahaha
i have not seen anything from hornung
do not throw your great grandson under the bus
lucas did not know where he was when he showed up, to be fair.
i know for a fact that you did not know you were at dads night initially. 
"aww shit yeah!!"


                             -lucas raub, 2016.
he was born in 93 ya jackass
