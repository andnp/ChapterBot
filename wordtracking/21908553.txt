i'm gonna give it a day or two 
i see what you did lucas 
when is the next candle pass? 
listening to two sorrorstitutes at wells talk about why guys always tell them that they "don't have a personality" hahahaha 
did justin not want to be in the new groupme? 
jesus christ 
absolutely 
being afraid people will think you are gay is pleb shit. we are confident in out heterosexuality 
that was only 1% your provocation in my opinion. the rest was cookie being cookie 
i thought if someone was kicked they couldn't re-enter? 
so add then immediately kick? 
fucking sweet! mccormicks creek will be fun af 
how could we say no???
let's build a fort 
#cookieshit 
the only one i know of is right in the main building and to the left 
at some point, could someone pick me up from mcnutt to go to the house? call me self conscious but i don't want to walk 25 minutes through campus with a pillow and blanket under my arm 
aaron is here already but thank you :) 
you are sure, it does. 
where the fack are all of you
you realize there is free food involved 
thank you for saying that now 
sorry i'm snippy because hang over 
welp i just woke up
i slept like a baby... hiding underneath three blankets 
must happen again 
good day in general 
be careful homie 
sweet, i'll give you money when we meet up to go there 
just found some gems on my phone guys 




i just wanted to provide some visual proof that brother bonding was a complete success this weekend 
'twas a good night, wish i remembered more of it 
but what i do remember is that mason and i went 3-0 in beer pong. 
almost? alright so i guess it wasn't a complete success
i smoked weed with johnny hopkins and sloan kettery 
story time! 
i'm so pissed that this isn't a thing that still happens 
i'm bringing it back, what website did you guys use for the printout? 
what other cool traditions have died off? 
i has an idea 
surprisingly i would not be apposed to this. 
i like aaron's idea of embarrassing photos of all brothers 
embarrassing pictures of drunk everyone arranged to resemble a kdr group photo? 
what app is that? 
yes 
a firm or class project or student organization? 
i don't know anything about photoshop or i would help haha i want to here more about it though 
https://vine.co/v/mvbztmx3m1a
forest for lunch anyone? 10 minutes 
or wright if anyone really wants 
if you're 70 you'll eat dinner now
but i will meet you for dinner later since i found out my class is no longer mandatory 😏😏
Hehehe yes
Grow in size was said 9 times but only 3 suggested increasing brother involvement in recruitment? That's troubling to me
I think we all already understand these are all questions that need to be addressed, but we've only just begun the organized process.
And little 5 would knock out a lot of those I 
Little five is forever away
You can train and not "commit" to a team. I think it's a little irrational and impulsive to commit to a different team than your own fraternity just because nobody else has committed more than a year in advance. That's just my opinion.
Andy if you need any help with any of this I would really enjoy helping out.
Did you read my first sentence?
Do what you do Will.
I'll bring it up in the social meeting tonight and it's certainly something that should be talked about in recruitment on Thursday.
I would really enjoy it if there was some sort of encouragement for brothers to join clubs/student organizations on campus. It's really a win win. Sure it takes time but joining clubs and organizations is great for Brothers personal/professional development and good for recruitment
Yes yes yes
I don't think you need to worry about #2 all that much. It's not hard to find a club that only requires an hour or two a week. Last semester I was in Oxfam, Psychology Club, ADAPT Consulting, The Human Resource Association, and ISUA and spent maybe 2 hours a week on all of them out together
Some clubs require more time than others. Just find relevant ones that don't require that much
Just because brothers don't want to do something doesn't mean we should quit and not try though. Part of being in a fraternity is going out of your comfort zone for yourself and your brothers even if it isn't something you want to do. Also, just because brothers don't WANT to do something doesn't mean they SHOULDNT do something. Be your brothers keeper and push them.
Well we should look into what hosting one exactly entails before we toss the idea
For all we know it's the exact same thing except for the place and title of the event
That'd be so cool haha
It's not hard either, professors love students that care. For example if you asked a CS professor to come talk to us for an hour I'm sure that they would and if they did it's only going to build your connection with that professor which will help you in the long run
That'd be sweet, at least four of our brothers are interested in that that I know of
Holy shit yes a networking event with professor would be sweet
I got excited
My parents won't be able to come but that would be a great idea. And from a psychological standpoint that would be great for brother bonding because everyone would feel much closer knowing everyone's families and backgrounds
Yeah, it sounds silly but that talk really just made me feel better about KDR in general. It's nice to actually see new ideas and have them be backed up and supported
Organizational Development Committee
I'd like to hear more about it first so I could make an informed decision but that sounds up my alley since it sounds like I could really apply my I/O knowledge
My class is starting but let the records show I am interested
Make sure to wear letters!
will be there in 10 minutes 
have a booth in the very back of the cut above area 
yeah, side not and sorry for randomly being serious but i think it's a good idea to wear letters when doing stuff like that 
yassss i posted this 
where are we meeting? 
does anyone want to buy my ticket and go to the comedy show tonight? 
the extra money would outweigh expenses. also, we have 25 brothers now. increasing dues by $25 would bring in over $600
when are we meeting for comedy? 
oh ish, i'll be there soon 
are any brothers going to fort wayne on saturday? 
mason and i's fridge next year
 yeah, so uh 

now that's just bar equipment, beat a hookah 
well played 
but who controls the troops? royalty.
i mean any bar equipment can double as home equipment with money and a determined mid 30's man who won't let go of "the glory days" when he used to party 
yesssss 
yes, i'd like us all to talk about who should be in the group in person 
hey iris

can we change her avatar to some sexy computerised woman? 
i'd burry my dick so far in that ass they'd call it excalibur. 
i see what you did aaron, i see 
could iris be linked to qualtrics and notify the group at benchmark amount of survey responses? like when we hit 5 replies iris notifies us
don't go out of your way now but that'd be awesome for the future 
that'd be so cool! i love us being the guinea pig committee (not sarcastic) 
i talked to one of my professors today and he said he would be glad to come talk to all of us for some sort of professor event 
i was thinking even if nobody in kdr is really interested in his field, he could just do a general qa on what academia is like, grad school, professors point of view, offices hours, etc. 
specifically he is a cognitive psychologist but he said he would cater the talk towards computer science if we wanted 
"your such a hipster piece of shit" - lucas 
"uhhh... i like literally every song by them.... but if the chapter starts listening to them then i'll have to find a new indie band" - also kas
lucas*
if he was an undergrad, we'd bid him 
this is an imformal groupme 
although i am still embarrassed 
no but i know rick 
of rick*
jordan delong, he has a personal website if you guys care enough to google him 
how do you know him? are you a psych major?
so i'm in wells and there is a group of guys in a glass room and they are fully convinced that it is soundproof glass and its quite hilarious
iris add task get survey questions from committee heads for next survey
can we have like all of my messages so i feel better about myself?
iris add task package survey answers and give appropriate answers to appropriate committees 
iris get todos
that'd be so cool
i'm going to be thinking of new things she could do all day tomorrow
can you have her communicate with other committees? like if i ask her to send a message to social 
but only allow chairs to have this ability 
nevermind, that could be bad. could hinder intergroup communication 
like real person to person communication
maybe notify committees of new events
but no i haven't heard of todoit
wait
yeah nvm i've never heard of it, i use any.do
sorry i had a brain fart there
yeah, like a kdr event notifier
social makes an event, discussion gets notified
maybe even allow the chair to add a blurb about the event
chubby 
pale
as long as we don't end up doing bitch work for other committees. i want to make it clear i really agree with what you said because we need to get things done but i don't see what's stopping taylor from calling or going to campus legal services himself 
ahhhh confused, i'm on board now (not sarcastic) 
it took me 10 minutes to catch up to this point 
and let me say 
y'all niggas need jesus 
yeshua*
jeebus* fucking autocorrect 
chill 
i concur 
hahahahahaah same 
#absurdism 
you'll never have the same consciousness unless you experience the exact same things as well 
really high percentage though 
like in the 90's 
we had a chart in my psych class i just don't remember the percentages 
that's a mathematical thing though not us getting stupider  
ahhh isee, i'm much more on board with that 
i haven't been keeping up with the chat 
it's a computer not a person that made the call. it's over 
whatd i miss? 
how it doin???? 
when? i'll probably come hang out but won't eat because poor 
i'm leaving the lab now, can you pick me up at psych? 
bubs 
rev
rt*
yeah, and either way i don't do drugs. that stuff is bad for you 
drugs or dark matter? 
tachyons man 
does ifc have an email so we can just ask them? 
after they've done that, would you like me to contact rusnak as the chair of org. dev., aaron as our risk manager, or taylor as head of pr? 
ayyyyy just got officially offered a ta spot for next year 
i could see it going all three ways but i think it makes the most sense for you to do it haha 
it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog. 
😳😳😳😳 i love it 
will it send them a message? 
i've seen that app! 
best of luck, feel free to call or text if you need someone to talk too. 
i'm just not creative enough to use it haha 
yeah! minimize all the risks! 
why aren't people at 509
fucking dittmer 
what time did last night end? 
oh no 
the hangover is hitting so hard and i'm stuck in a car for the next hour and a half 
i'm dying 
😂😂😂😂
andy & aaron. i'm pretty sure i owe you guys a package of ham salami and like 8 craft singles 
it'd be so easy to poison that dog 
just throw some rat poison in their food and go back downstairs and go back to your day 
retweet, chief is tired of confrontation. everybody love everybody. 
but will, in a non-condescending way the hints given during the drinking game are intended to be horseshit hints that don't help at all, so knowing their dad wouldn't really make a difference until the very end and by then we all usually know who via peter 
welp nevermind 
wait i get it 
crown royal. the few. the proud. the better than you. 
isn't malibu just a mixing drink?
to be completely honest i thought it was until my dads night 
what are other dead houses? 
liked page
i'd be willing to split a fifth with mason 


loren is a savage 
i like it 
but... 
y'all still some bumbass  niggas 

another act of savagery 
it's entertaining which is all that matters 
mr hibachi before dads night on saturday? 
isn't mr hibachi just the buffet?
if so, only like 10% of their menu is sushi. if not, which one is the good buffet in town? 
still, the place i was thinking of doesn't even focus on sushi it's just a general chinese buffet 
i need second opinion before i'm convinced. andy you're the only certified statamagician here (so for reminding you jeff), what do you have to say? 
sure! can we name her?? i think iris is a great name 
hahaha 
just screech like a peregrine falcon 
they will come running 
introverts are cute anyway 
yes
she can't defy her master andy 
sweet, that will be useful for other committees later on 
i'm scared 
jesus hahaha 
you are so dedicated and smart andy it scares me 
think smarter not harder haha 
hey loren, if you find eta chapter tell them i said "honor super omnia" don't worry they'll know what it means 
only one way to find out 
hey guys, if you haven't already seen in multiple messages andy and i would really like you guys to take the survey that we made for kdr. i'm looking at the results now and in 9 responses we already have over a dozen nu ideas for brother bonding, recruitment, and social events next year as well as a lot of ideas for chapter development. it's anonymous and looking at the average time now it only takes about 10 minutes to put serious responses and if you ask me its worth it because you are really helping the chapter and your brothers. its anonymous and a great way to give ideas and constructive feedback you haven't been able to give already. andy will be using the information to give a presentation at chapter like last time (maybe more detailed as far as actual ideas) so get your ideas heard!!!  https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/se/?sid=sv_e5sxgkgu9uvylg1
also, the eli and one of our richest alumni members will be at the next chapter. so more = us looking better = more money from alumni & more slack from nationals
tldr taking the survey is short and easy and helps the brothers and your chapter
10
9*
you'll be fine you're at the end of the line 
we can come up with them together while the older brothers go 
i think so 
so aaron sent me the minutes from tonight's meeting and i would like to add a few things. i think that brothers meals should be subsidised in some way. maybe not 100% but something like 1/2 or 1/3 or a straight $5 for food for themselves along with the pnm food being paid for. in an ideal world our brothers wouldn't need this incentive, but right now i think we need an extra push to get brothers more involved and that would be a great incentive. 
additionally, it should absolutely not be allowed for pnms to know that the chapter is paying. i don't know about you guys but i would've felt like a number not a person. if they think the brother is paying it would be a much more personal thing. 
what are your thoughts on my second message everyone? i think it's a little more "out there" but if we're being honest it cant hurt and i truly think it would help. making the meal more personal would foster a real connection and friendship better. 
fair 
i like that jeff, but still keep it ambiguous. "the chapter helps pay" not "yeah i need the receipt so the chapter will give me money for my food for taking you out" 
the way the conversation is going so smoothly and productively in the rush chat right now has my dick hard 
yeah, we don't want them to think they are getting used for a free meal by a brother haha not only is that shitty but it makes it much less personal and much more business 
good, so that is sorted out then! 
lastly, this should really be a brother and younger pnm thing. for instance, i have a friend who is a freshmen to and i'm going to try and get him to join next year. i think it'd be super awkward if i took him out and paid for his food. why does this need said? 1. kdr guys are socially awkward and don't always understand social norms. 2. brothers might take out their friends or people they don't really see as pnms as friends so they get their food partially paid for. 
it has to be quick though 
quick as in a few minutes at most 
brothers need to be given the benefit of the doubt in some situations though. if i'm not at 509 sitting next to aaron or jeff or patrick and neither of them happen to be looking at their phone i don't want to pass up a chance to bond with a pnms because i don't have approval for $15 of food. people not being at their phones is a real issue. and not all brothers are ok with saying "fuck it" and taking someone and just hoping it gets pid for 
if someone cheats the committee and we are out $15 i think it's worth it for the sake of all the other pnms that gotten taken to eat. big picture 
but what if it's outside of the event? what if they are just chilling? 
as brother and pnms of course 
pnm*
we aren't making plans for next year we are making plans for the future of the rush committee though 
down the road, brothers might be 
and after all, our goal is to boost brother involvement, if we succeed we need to be ready 
plus just hanging out with a pnm or getting foot outside of an event doesn't mean they are giving a bid 
food*
reread my last message haha 
@aaron johnson 
what jeff said 
right?!?! and i love facilitating 
no damnit you can't take away my right to make your decisions for you jeff! 
does brotherhood mean nothing to you??? 
one last thing, i'll kill a baby for you  if you take the survey https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/se/?sid=sv_e5sxgkgu9uvylg1
i dont fuck around jeff, you'll learn that soon 
candle pass is a slap in the face of everything clinical psychology has discovered about group therapy in recent history. but it can be really useful and fun
 the colon might have thrown her off 
ahhh
candle pass is tradition but i'd really like to revise how it's done and make it more therapeutic and constructive than giving people the chance to bash people and get away with it. 
#organizationaldevelopementcommittee
rather than*
i like patty, not as ready for leadership but more open minded 
i'd love to see what he can do. make sure he knows that if brothers say there coming it doesn't necessarily mean they are coming and excited haha i'd encourage him to get phone numbers and not necessarily text people to just remind them but start conversation and bring it up 
u good cuh? 
i'm telling meredith 
savage 
i'm down 
my dues are in the mail! 
here next time, no worries though 
@matt levine 
hey! that's my brother's house! 
yes, in meeting, over at 7 
on way to 509 
even closer 
i won't be able to make it because i'm going to indy 
delta beta zeta? 
i mean they obviously participated in deforestation and ungodly bonfires but  "destroyed the country"? nah 
and nothing like what other people's were doing at that time 
speculation... right, i'm sure it had nothing to do with any other legitimate and proven climate related phenomena 
so you're telling me the naturalistic and animistic native americans cut down so many trees that when they grew back it created an iceage? i'm taking a nap 
siting one source doesn't create a valid argument, you do that shit all the time 
so what i'm getting out of this is if white people hadn't showed up everything would've been fine 
as is tradition 
i don't think a few articles prove native americans caused the little ice age. there are many other equally and more valid theories like cyclical lows in solar radiation, heightened volcanic activity, changes in the ocean circulation, or an inherent variability in global climate (wiki) that i'm sure are much more widely accepted in the scientific community. either way, it's not like native americans were hippy douchebags that didn't eat meat or cut down trees. it was about being one with nature and trying to respect it while using it 
that awkward moment when the lights turn off in the psych building while your taking a poop 
bathroom*
i think it's interesting too! have other researchers done any work on it or just the piece from stanford? 
also, of i join the native american church i'm pretty sure i can get peyote 
i'm looking into it 
i've been to some of the cities in arizona but never in the midwest or other parts of america 
they're pretty cool. nowhere near as developed as the tribe in central and south america but still amazing 
i can't believe there haven't been any al gore references yet 
we should have a debate groupme with a new topic every week!!
that'd be fucking fun 
i love that shit 
have someone steal a roll from one of the dorm bathrooms they are easy to take and fucking hgr 
huge*
pics or it didn't happen  
where is everyone?! they are almost here 
oh you're one of those students 
hahaha okay alumni 
quality > quantity, isn't that your rule? 
no idea 
really? looks like a bmw 550i to me 
and to think i liked your mini cooper message 
i don't know i unliked it 
has anyone got tom in contact with sam about updating our email list? 
there is a dude standing the courtyard at mcnutt smoking a j 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
not even hiding it 
hell yeah only mason knows how to add stuff to the calendar haha 
iris add a todo 
boom 
now
😂😂😂😂😂
on any usual day or week i would be more than willing to do so, but i'm so swamped with research assistant work.  could you make it andy? 
i'm really sorry 
and penis 
she probably got confused by your semicolon 
iris complete todo boom 
no 
iris complete todo boom for recruitment 
oh nevermind 
no
oh no 
dude friday and barbecue outside the dorms during welcome with with a kdr sign that's perfect 
i don't know what friday was supposed to be but it was a typo so add a relevant word of your choice 
music? 
frisbee!!! (or sport ball in general) 
yeah... yeah that was on purpose! 
ifc said that's a no no 
maybe we could work around it in a way but ifc doesn't want greek organizations helping people move in 
it's supposed to be an invasion of the last minutes of family time people have 
change it to face and i'm in 
if we're breaking rules then i'm gonna start selling cocaine for the chapter again 
or water 
that's genius 
we could always just start the fire 
hit ashton and collins 
quaestor will 
let's add it to the todos 
what's paired up? 
phired
iris at todo for recruitment 
wait a second i forget how 
that's awesome!!! 
do you care if i add the thing to the todos? 
iris add todo dorm storm to recruitment 
yes
dorm storm 
next recruitment meeting
my bad homie 
sleep time, goodnight iris and andy 
i'm down for the quarry 
we should go again when it's warm  and jump off 
loren we are watching the same episode right now 
who is matt chambers? 
i can gleam that he was bidded haha i mean what is he like/look like 
is he the hipster one? 
if so, that's my nigga 
damnnnn 
so many matts 
too much homework
i'm cutting myself 
you've done this to me 
look at the light glean off the blood.
look at it loren 
will you're coming to lunch with spencer and i tomorrow 
pussies 
hopefully 
mason had a gshcok

i just wanted to cause a ruckus i don't actually agree with the message hahahah 
yeah that's the first thing i thought of. according to this chart many more white people are killed by police but they also make up over 70% of the population whereas black people make up ~12%
congratulations loren! 
a guy in my discussion class last week told our professor that he's smoked weed everyday for four years 
massucci is my nigga 
so there's a germany and a deutschland or are they the same? 
god i love collins 
i don't know man all you can eat hot dogs, mac and cheese, and cheeseburgers today 
on a regular day red lobster though 
plus the hipsters, i feel so at home here 
i think we should do greek family dinners next year once a week at collins or wright 
and make them mandatory 
i've had brothers tell me they've talked to alumni and years ago the nu chapter used to do it twice a week 
at their house granted but we don't have a real house now 
👦🏽
there's an emoji for me now! 
👦🏿they added a gorilla too! 
i want his vest so bad 
yeah man! there's a video on hoosier nation 

hey man i like his stubble 

i did not do this haha but it's like 1/4 ply anyway 
just go to one of the restrooms on campus and steal it! i plan on doing all next year for toilet paper and paper towels 
#hoc
