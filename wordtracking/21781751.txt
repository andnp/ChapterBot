i think you're fucking retarded
it looks like this or sometimes it disguises itself as a sports whatever major because it's too fucking retarded to get a real major that's gonna make real money so in his little retarded brain it thinks 'oh if i watch espn all day i can get a degree' when in actuality it gets you nowhere except being made fun of
 or it also disguises itself as a fucking ginger but if you're both well then by golly the l-rd was really pissed off when he made you didn't he? i bet that soul went right up to g-d and was like you know what? just fuck my shit up' and then out pops our little fuckboys aaron!

i have a picture of something like that if someone's interested 
assuming the notion that jesus was real
bring the thunder!
it depends on the jew you ask most denounce the notion that he even existed
please will show me said documents
see my thing is that he kept claiming he was the son of god and had all of these powers but if he truly was the son of god he would do what the bible in the old testament said he would do, for example, basically rebuild the military in israel and bring them as the dominant country
fun fact his name really isn't jesus, it's yeshua see when you take his name in hebrew (the original language of the bible) and turn it into greek, the next people to go to christianity and then put it into latin, the next people to use the bible, you get jesus, since greek doesn't have a 'y' sound they changed it to j and then they dropped the 'sh' sound and made it an s and since common male names back in the day had an s they added an s
and then you get the name jesus
and that's how the jew ruined christmas 
honestly in my time being a jew i've only heard the term yhwh a handful of times
at hillel?
730
jesus does meth what are you talking about?
he'd be smoking weed with sloan kettering 
not really
the way it was explained to me was that you spent time in a purgatory type state for 'cleansing' before you go to heaven and even then it's not as good as people make it our to be it was also explained that the life you live is the best part of the cycle and that heaven was just a place you go after you die
the raabi also told me that it was like a washing machine for your soul and then that's when i called bs nobody describes an after life as a washing machine
i don't know my stance on that yet
i find that experience parallels mine, i respect that
yeah but see here is my take on that too how could you get all of these atoms to work together to form complex life and intelligence? you can't put the pieces to a watch in a box shake it up and expect a watch to come out
i have takes on a lot of things
i think g-d was the reason that everything exists as perfectly as it does i don't think it's just a coincidence that we just so happen to live in a perfect state that supports life
everyone keeps talking about having the 'right' environment the 'right' something i find it no coincidence there is a g-d
yeah because in like 500 million years the milky way galaxy is going to collide with the andromeda galaxy
look it up

i confirm
people deemed attractive are more than likely below the curve anyways
^^^ he's right

no i do i got a 5 on the ap stats exam i'm just saying they can easily be manipulated, for example, you can have statistical data with a mean of whatever and it can be a statistically significant change but practically unimportant there's more to statistics than just numbers
i fully reject bayesian statistics


that's why you need to find an appropriate sample size, not too big not too small and yes there is such a thing as too big of a penis i mean sample size


http://blog.minitab.com/blog/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis/large-samples-too-much-of-a-good-thing
going back on how sample size can make things statistically significant but practically not
i feel like you guys are just trolling 
that statement was a form of truism
