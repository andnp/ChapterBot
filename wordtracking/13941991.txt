the purpose of the overnight event is to get the new guys drunk (if they are willing) and see what they are like and making them more comfortable around alcohol. since its overnight we can have them stay and take care of them.
lol i understand. i know it's asking a lot but i think this is the best way to make sure getting the new guys drunk and around us for the first time.
that didn't make sense. i was supposed to add a goes "smoothly" somewhere in there.

i still have to change but then i'll be there.

it just says olympics.
there's no mention of beer.
